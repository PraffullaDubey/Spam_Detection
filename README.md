# Spam_Detection
Spam Detection in Emails.
In this project I have tried to detect whether the email is spam or not. The alogrithim used in this project is Naive Bayes algorithim. We can decide whether the email is spam or not by checking the 'stopwords' and training or model such that if our model finds there are stopwords then it detects the email as spam.
